    <h4><b>What Is Internet Book Mission?</b></h4>
    <br>
    <p><b>Internet Book Mission</b> is decided to have launched by the end of Dec 2022. The project's main aim is to provide knowledge according to our YouTube channel's theme and the second aim is to popularize our channel Bar Data. Bar Data though has gained many views but has failed to gain subscribers significantly. Webpages will be created for each topic included in our theme. Our expected webpages are atleast 20 by Feb 2023. Internet Book Mission is not associated with any other organisation/group/developpers. Internet Book Mission aims at providing knowledge free and easily. Without buying a book, you will be able to gain knowledge. The suggested topics will also be chosen. If you want topics you suggest yu have to kindly suggest in any of the community posts in Bar Data YouTube channel. If possible, we will try.</p>
